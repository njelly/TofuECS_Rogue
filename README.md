![TofuECS Rogue](Assets/_Game/Art/logo_1.png "TofuECS_Rogue")

---

An example rouge-like using [the TofuECS framework](https://github.com/njelly/TofuECS). Very, very much in development. Made in Unity.

This repo also uses code from [TofuBootstrap](https://github.com/njelly/TofuBootstrap), which is just a personal collection of tools that aren't relevant to TofuECS. They just help me to set up Unity projects to my own taste.
